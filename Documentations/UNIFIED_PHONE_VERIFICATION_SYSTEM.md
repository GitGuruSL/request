# Enhanced Unified Phone Verification System with Country-Specific SMS

## Overview
This document describes the enhanced unified phone verification system that integrates both the unified verification logic and country-specific SMS delivery for the Request Marketplace application. The system provides consistent phone verification across all user flows while using cost-effective, country-specific SMS providers.

## System Architecture

### Database Tables
1. **`users`** - Main user table with personal contact information
   - `phone` - Personal phone number
   - `phone_verified` - Personal phone verification status
   - `email` - Primary email address
   - `email_verified` - Email verification status

2. **`user_phone_numbers`** - Professional phone numbers table
   - `user_id` - Reference to users table
   - `phone_number` - Professional phone number (normalized format)
   - `is_verified` - Verification status
   - `purpose` - Purpose of phone (business_verification, driver_verification, profile_update, etc.)
   - `phone_type` - Type classification (professional, personal, business, etc.)

3. **`sms_configurations`** - Country-specific SMS provider configurations (Admin managed)
   - `country_code` - Country code (LK, IN, US, UK, AE, etc.)
   - `active_provider` - SMS provider (twilio, aws, vonage, local)
   - `approval_status` - Configuration approval status (pending, approved, rejected)
   - `is_active` - Configuration active status

4. **`phone_otp_verifications`** - OTP verification records
   - `phone` - Phone number
   - `otp` - OTP code
   - `otp_id` - Unique OTP identifier
   - `country_code` - Country used for SMS delivery
   - `provider_used` - SMS provider used for delivery
   - `verification_type` - Type of verification (login, business_verification, driver_verification, profile_update)

5. **`business_verifications`** & **`driver_verifications`** - Verification records
   - `phone_verified` - Auto-populated verification status
   - `email_verified` - Auto-populated verification status

### Phone Number Classification
- **Personal Phone**: Stored in `users.phone`, used for account registration and login
- **Professional Phone**: Stored in `user_phone_numbers`, used for business/driver verification and professional activities

### Country-Specific SMS Integration
- **Country Detection**: Automatic country detection from phone number format
- **Provider Selection**: Uses approved SMS configurations per country
- **Cost Optimization**: Local SMS providers for each country reduce costs by 50-80%
- **Admin Management**: Country admins configure providers, super admins approve configurations

## Verification Logic

### Phone Verification Priority Order
The system follows this priority order for phone verification:

1. **Professional Phone Check**: Check if phone exists in `user_phone_numbers` as verified
   - If found and verified → Phone is verified
   - Source: `user_phone_numbers`, Type: `professional`

2. **Personal Phone Check**: Check if phone matches user's personal phone and is verified
   - If matches and verified → Phone is verified
   - Source: `users_table`, Type: `personal`

3. **Auto-Update**: If user has no personal phone, update it with provided phone
   - Updates `users.phone` with normalized phone number
   - Requires manual verification

4. **OTP Verification**: Send OTP using country-specific SMS provider
   - Auto-detects country from phone number
   - Uses approved SMS configuration for that country
   - Stores verification in `user_phone_numbers` table

### Email Verification Process
The system checks email verification:

1. **User Email Check**: If email matches user's email and is verified
   - Source: `users_table`

2. **Auto-Update**: If user has no email, update it with provided email
   - Updates `users.email` with provided email
   - Requires manual verification

### Phone Number Normalization
All phone numbers are normalized to international format:
- Input: `0725742238` → Output: `+94725742238` (Sri Lanka)
- Input: `94725742238` → Output: `+94725742238`
- Input: `725742238` → Output: `+94725742238`
- Input: `+94725742238` → Output: `+94725742238`
- Supports multiple countries: LK, IN, US, UK, AE
