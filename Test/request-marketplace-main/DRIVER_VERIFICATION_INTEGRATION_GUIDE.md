## üöÄ Quick Integration Steps

### Step 1: Add Driver Dashboard to Home Screen

```dart
// In your home screen widget
import 'package:your_app/src/drivers/driver_status_dashboard.dart';
import 'package:your_app/src/services/driver_verification_service.dart';

// Add this to your home screen body:
FutureBuilder<bool>(
  future: DriverVerificationService().isDriver(),
  builder: (context, snapshot) {
    if (snapshot.data == true) {
      return StreamBuilder<Map<String, dynamic>>(
        stream: DriverVerificationService().streamVerificationStatus(),
        builder: (context, statusSnapshot) {
          if (statusSnapshot.hasData && statusSnapshot.data!['error'] == null) {
            return VerificationNotificationBanner(
              verificationSummary: statusSnapshot.data!,
              onTap: () {
                Navigator.push(
                  context,
                  MaterialPageRoute(
                    builder: (context) => const DriverVerificationScreen(),
                  ),
                );
              },
            );
          }
          return const SizedBox.shrink();
        },
      );
    }
    return const SizedBox.shrink();
  },
),
```

### Step 2: Add Driver Navigation Option

```dart
// In your navigation drawer or bottom navigation:
ListTile(
  leading: const Icon(Icons.verified_user),
  title: const Text('Driver Verification'),
  onTap: () {
    Navigator.push(
      context,
      MaterialPageRoute(
        builder: (context) => const DriverVerificationScreen(),
      ),
    );
  },
),
```

### Step 3: Protect Response Posting

```dart
// Before allowing users to respond to requests:
import 'package:your_app/src/services/response_posting_service.dart';

Future<void> _submitResponse() async {
  final canPost = await ResponsePostingService.canDriverPostResponses();
  
  if (!canPost) {
    // Show verification required message
    ScaffoldMessenger.of(context).showSnackBar(
      const SnackBar(
        content: Text('Please complete driver verification to respond'),
        backgroundColor: Colors.red,
      ),
    );
    
    // Navigate to verification screen
    Navigator.push(
      context,
      MaterialPageRoute(
        builder: (context) => const DriverVerificationScreen(),
      ),
    );
    return;
  }
  
  // Proceed with response submission
  // Your existing response logic here
}
```

);
```

### Response Posting Service Methods

```dart
// Check verification before posting
