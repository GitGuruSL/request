- `double? _latitude;`
- `double? _longitude;`
- `final Location _location = Location();`

**Added Methods:**

**Updated UI:**

- `List<File> _selectedImages = [];`
- `String? _selectedLocation;`
- `double? _latitude;`
- `double? _longitude;`

## Features

### Location Picker Options:
1. **Use Current Location**: Gets GPS coordinates and converts to readable address
2. **Enter Location Manually**: Shows dialog to type location manually

### Consistent UI:
- Both request and response forms now have identical location selection UI
- Location shows as a card with location icon
- Displays selected location or placeholder text
- Subtitle shows "Tap to change location" when location is selected

### Error Handling:
- Handles location permission requests
- Graceful fallback to coordinates if reverse geocoding fails
- Shows error messages for location service issues

## Technical Details

### Dependencies Used:
- `location: ^5.0.3` - For GPS location access
- `geocoding: ^3.0.0` - For converting coordinates to addresses

### Permission Handling:
- Requests location service enablement
- Requests location permissions
- Handles denied permissions gracefully

### Data Storage:
- Stores location as text string
- Optionally stores latitude/longitude coordinates
- Passes location data to backend services

## User Experience

### Request Form:
- Users can now select location when creating requests
- Location is optional but helps with matching
- Consistent with response form behavior

### Response Form:
- Fixed all compilation errors
- Maintained existing location picker functionality
- All features working properly

## Testing

Created test file (`/test/location_picker_test.dart`) to verify:
- Location picker widgets are present in both screens
- UI elements are properly rendered
- Integration with existing forms works correctly

The location picker now provides a consistent, user-friendly experience across both request creation and response submission forms.
