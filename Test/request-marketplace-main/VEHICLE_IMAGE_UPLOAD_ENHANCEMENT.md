# ðŸš— Enhanced Vehicle Image Upload System

## Overview
I've successfully implemented an enhanced vehicle image upload system for the driver profile that provides clear guidance for uploading vehicle images with specific requirements for the first two images.

## âœ¨ Key Features

### ðŸ“¸ Structured Photo Requirements
- **1st Image**: Front view with number plate clearly visible
- **2nd Image**: Back view with number plate clearly visible  
- **3rd+ Images**: Any additional angles (side, interior, etc.)

### ðŸŽ¨ Enhanced User Interface

#### Driver Verification Screen (`driver_verification_screen.dart`)
- **Clear Requirements Section**: Visual guide showing what photos are needed
- **Image Labels**: Each uploaded image shows its purpose (FRONT + NUMBER PLATE, BACK + NUMBER PLATE, ADDITIONAL PHOTO)
- **Contextual Upload Buttons**: Button text changes based on progress:
  - "Upload Front View (1/4)"
  - "Upload Back View (2/4)" 
  - "Upload Additional Photo (3/4)"
  - "Upload Final Photo (4/4)"
- **Smart Guidance**: Helpful hints about which photo to upload next
- **Visual Status**: Color-coded approval status for each image

#### Driver Registration Screen (`driver_registration_screen.dart`)
- **Consistent Interface**: Same visual requirements and labeling system
- **Compact Layout**: Optimized for the registration flow
- **Progress Indicators**: Shows upload progress with clear labels

### ðŸ”§ Technical Implementation

#### Enhanced Grid Display
- **Labeled Images**: Each image slot shows its intended purpose
- **Visual Hierarchy**: First two images highlighted with blue styling
- **Status Indicators**: Approval status badges on each image
- **Professional Layout**: Better aspect ratios and spacing

#### Smart Upload Flow
- **Contextual Guidance**: Users know exactly what to upload next
- **Progress Tracking**: Clear indication of completion status
- **Requirement Validation**: System ensures minimum requirements are met

#### Helper Methods
- `_buildRequirement()`: Creates consistent requirement list items
- `_getUploadButtonText()`: Dynamic button text based on progress
- `_buildPhotoRequirement()`: Registration screen requirement items
- `_getAddPhotoText()`: Context-aware add photo button text

## ðŸ“± User Experience Improvements

This creates a more professional, user-friendly experience while ensuring better quality submissions for admin review.
