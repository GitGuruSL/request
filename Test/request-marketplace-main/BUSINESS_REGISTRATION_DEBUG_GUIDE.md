/**
 * Business Registration Troubleshooting Guide
 * 
 * Common Issues and Solutions:
 * 
 * 1. USER AUTHENTICATION
 *    - Issue: User not authenticated
 *    - Solution: Ensure user is logged in before accessing registration
 *    - Check: widget.userId is not null or empty
 * 
 * 2. FIRESTORE PERMISSIONS
 *    - Issue: Firestore rules blocking write operations
 *    - Solution: Check firestore.rules file
 *    - Current rules should allow authenticated users to write to their user doc
 * 
 * 3. NETWORK CONNECTION
 *    - Issue: No internet connection
 *    - Solution: Check device network connectivity
 * 
 * 4. FORM VALIDATION
 *    - Issue: Required fields not filled
 *    - Solution: Check form validation logic
 * 
 * 5. BUSINESS PROFILE MODEL
 *    - Issue: BusinessProfile model serialization errors
 *    - Solution: Verify toMap() method in BusinessProfile class
 * 
 * 6. USER DOCUMENT EXISTENCE
 *    - Issue: User document doesn't exist in Firestore
 *    - Solution: Create user document first or use set() instead of update()
 * 
 * DEBUGGING STEPS:
 * 
 * 1. Use the debug buttons added to the registration screen
 * 2. Check Flutter console logs for detailed error messages
 * 3. Verify user ID is valid
 * 4. Test Firestore connectivity
 * 5. Check browser network tab for failed requests
 * 
 * IMPROVED ERROR HANDLING:
 * - Added comprehensive logging to submission process
 * - Enhanced error messages with stack traces
 * - Added user document existence check
 * - Improved navigation after successful registration
