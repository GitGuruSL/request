# Business Pricing Management Verification System

## Overview
The business verification system supports a **centralized product catalog** where businesses can only add pricing to existing products. This ensures accurate price comparison and prevents product duplication.

## Centralized Product System Design

### üéØ Core Concept
- **Master Products**: Predefined in centralized catalog (e.g., "iPhone 15 Pro 128GB")
- **Business Listings**: Businesses add their pricing, delivery, and warranty info to existing products
- **Price Comparison**: Works perfectly because all businesses reference the same master product
- **No Duplication**: Prevents "iPhone 15 Pro" vs "iPhone15Pro" vs "iPhone 15Pro" issues

### üõ°Ô∏è Verification Levels

#### 1. Basic Pricing Access (Email + Phone Verification)
- **Requirements**: Email and phone verification only
- **Permissions**: 
  - ‚úÖ Search centralized product catalog
  - ‚úÖ Add pricing to existing products
  - ‚úÖ Update pricing and inventory
  - ‚úÖ Manage delivery and warranty terms
- **Business Benefits**: Can start selling immediately after contact verification

#### 2. Full Marketplace Access (Complete Verification)

- **Permissions**:
  - ‚úÖ All basic pricing access features
  - ‚úÖ Premium marketplace features
  - ‚úÖ Enhanced business analytics

## Implementation

### BusinessVerification Model Methods

```dart
/// Check if business can add pricing to existing products (only requires email and phone verification)
bool get canAddProducts {
  return isEmailVerified && isPhoneVerified;
}

/// Check if business can manage pricing (same as canAddProducts)
bool get canManageProducts {
  return canAddProducts;
}

/// Check if business can receive full marketplace benefits (requires full verification)
bool get hasFullMarketplaceAccess {
  return isFullyVerified;
}
```

### BusinessService Verification Checks

#### Adding Pricing to Existing Products
```dart
Future<String?> addProductToCatalog({
  required String masterProductId,  // Reference to existing product
  required double price,            // Business pricing
  ...
}) async {
  // Get business profile
  final business = await getBusinessProfile(businessId);
  if (business == null) return null;

  // Check if business can add pricing (email and phone verification required)
  if (!business.verification.canAddProducts) {
    throw Exception('Email and phone verification required to add product pricing');
  }
  
  // Add business pricing to existing master product...
}
```

#### Updating Pricing
```dart
Future<bool> updateProductInCatalog(String productId, {...}) async {
  // Check if business can manage pricing
  if (!business.verification.canManageProducts) {
    throw Exception('Email and phone verification required to manage product pricing');
  }
  
  // Continue with pricing updates...
}
```
